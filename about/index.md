# About me


> I am currently pursuing my masters in Data Science from Defence Institute Of Advanced Technology(DRDO), I like to build things and understand the problems that one cannot  see through a strictly theoretical perspective. The process of theory and skills merging to develop a product excites me which led me towards the vast field of data science.

> Here I express my understanding of various concepts of Machine Learning and Mathematics.
