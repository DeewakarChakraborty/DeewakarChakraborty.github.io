Let us assume a dataset with data instances x and its corresponding label as y then there can be two types of modeling: Discriminative Modeling: It captures conditional probability p(y|x) Generative Modeling: It captures joint probability P(x,y) if its supervised learning otherwise P(x). \r(A simple illustration of how one can use discriminative vs generative models, img src:researchgate.net)\r In the case of generative modeling, the distribution p(x) is being learned and represented in latent space(z), latent space is a hidden representation of data point using which we try to generate x', this latent space z is learned representation which acts as inspiration so that we do not always get same x' as output. We humans also do something similar to it, lets take a scenario of reading a novel where x is the actual message author wants to convey different human being will have different interpretations z (unique hidden representation learnt by a human brain) and thus using these interpretations they will create their own understanding of author’s work x'.

This all changed in 2014 when Ian Goodfellow introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the world of machine learning, this technique enabled machines to generate realistic data. GANs are the class of ML techniques that consist of two simultaneously trained neural networks, one is Generator which is used to generate the fake data and other is Discriminator which is used to classify whether input given to it is real (image from training dataset) or fake (generated by the discriminator). The word generative in GAN indicates its sole purpose of generating new data, data that we want to generate depends on which dataset we have trained our GAN on. For example if we want to generate artwork similar to that of Pablo Picasso we will use his artwork as training dataset to train the GAN. The word adversarial refers to the game like competition between Generator and Discriminator where Generator tries to beat Discriminator by fooling it using its generated fake image in our example it means producing artwork exactly similar to that of Pablo Picasso’s whereas Discriminator objective is to discern the fake generated artwork from real. Finally the word network is used to indicate the class of ML technique that is used to represent Generator and Discriminator: Neural Networks.

The medical dataset is harder to come by, and they often require specialized equipment to collect. We have semi-supervised learning that helps to address the problem of small labeled datasets, this, however, addresses only half of the problem as in the case of semi-supervised learning we have a large dataset where only a small portion of the dataset is labeled, in healthcare applications this small portion is only data we have! For this problem, one of the solutions is to use standard data-augmentation techniques but using data-augmentation yields examples that do not diverge far from the original example and in the case of medical diagnostics, we want different examples of the same underlying pathology. Here comes GAN in the picture where it can be utilized to produce synthetic data to enlarge a training dataset. But GANs themselves need a lot of data to train, for this problem researchers brought an ingenious solution. First, they have used the standard data-augmentation techniques to create a larger dataset, and then they used this dataset to train a GAN to generate synthetic examples. This process further enriched the available dataset beyond standard data-augmentation techniques. Using GAN’s capability to synthesize high-quality images to enlarge the training dataset, in 2018 Frid-Adar decided to use GAN for medical data augmentation to improve the classification of liver lesions. The following chart shows their result: \r\r(This chart shows classification accuracy as new data is added on existing dataset using standard data-augmentation process and synthetic data generated using GAN.
